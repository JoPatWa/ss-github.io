        <p>Every traveler knows this: a good preparation is half the work. To make sure you do not get stressed on your vacation, make sure you have arranged everything around your trip in advance before departure. Make sure you have completed all your traveling paperwork, insurance, notified your bank of your departure and you have packed everything; including things you might need –it better to have more than less. This prevents you from jumping on the plane and thinking about things that may have been forgotten and cause anxiety which may disrupt your sleep. Everyone would like to get comfortable and equipped on a holiday destination and nothing is beats sleeping a couple of hours of a long flight. You would like to sleep during your flight, but you have trouble falling asleep. Here are tips to overcome avoid this issue<br>Make sure you do not fly with an empty stomach<br>This is very important: Before you fly make sure you’ve eaten something. It hard to function properly when you hungry, just like everything else it is hard to fall asleep on an empty stomach. Make sure you eat something when you fly and if you are skipping a meal, eat a fruit. Do not drink caffeine or alcohol before and during flight. Caffeine is sleep-inhibiting, something you cannot use if you plan to have a nice nap during your flight!</p>
<h1 id="Put-on-comfortable-clothes"><a href="#Put-on-comfortable-clothes" class="headerlink" title="Put on comfortable clothes"></a>Put on comfortable clothes</h1><p>If you have a long flight, it’s handy to wear comfortable clothes. A tight pair of jeans is less comfortable than a jogging pants or leggings. Bring a beanie to secure and keep your hair in place so you can sleep without worrying to wake up looking raggedy.  Basic clothing that needs to make it on your carry on is thick socks, comfortable sweater. If you get cold (especially your feet) it is difficult to fall asleep. </p>
<h1 id="Choose-a-window-seat"><a href="#Choose-a-window-seat" class="headerlink" title="Choose a window seat"></a>Choose a window seat</h1><p>Most airline companies can check in. When booking and checking in make sure you get a seat a window seat. Why? You can make yourself more comfortable by leaning on the window, and if your neighbor has to go to the bathroom, you will not be affected by it. Therefore you will get to sleep without being bothered.</p>
<h1 id="Bring-headphones-or-earplugs-with-you"><a href="#Bring-headphones-or-earplugs-with-you" class="headerlink" title="Bring headphones or earplugs with you"></a>Bring headphones or earplugs with you</h1><p>An airplane is always a little noisy once in the air. Also the people around you will talk, cough or babies will cry and fuss; that will make it hard to sleep. You can always plug in your earphones and listen to your audio book or mesmerizing music that will make you comfortable to sleep.  If you have earplugs, you can put them on and the sounds will reduce.</p>
